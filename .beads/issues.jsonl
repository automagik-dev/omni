Race condition: NATS closes ~4ms after disconnect events, listener may not process in time\n2. Something else setting `isActive = false` synchronously during shutdown\n3. The `isActive = true` from /connect route not being persisted correctly\n\n## Files to Investigate\n- `packages/api/src/plugins/event-listeners.ts:53-82` - disconnect event handler\n- `packages/api/src/plugins/instance-monitor.ts:458-488` - reconnectWithPool\n- `packages/api/src/index.ts:200-245` - shutdown handler\n- `packages/api/src/routes/v2/instances.ts:404` - connect route sets isActive\n\n## Suggested Fix\nConsider adding a separate field like `shouldAutoConnect` that represents user intent, separate from runtime `isActive` state.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"cezar@namastex.ai","created_at":"2026-02-02T12:40:00.265483211-03:00","created_by":"Cezar Vasconcelos","updated_at":"2026-02-02T19:12:39.452086738-03:00","closed_at":"2026-02-02T19:12:39.452086738-03:00","close_reason":"Fixed: Removed line that marked instances inactive on startup reconnect failure.
