## ⚠️ BRANCH WORKFLOW LESSON

**`dev` IS HOME. WE BELONG IN `dev`.**

From Felipe:
> WE ONLY WORK IN DEV BRANCH, THATS WHERE WE BELONG... TASKS RUN INTO WORKTREES AND GENERATE PRS BACK TO DEV, WE HAVE THE NIGHTLY SYSTEM

Updated AGENTS.md with full branch workflow section. Key rules:
- `dev` = active development, always work here
- `main` = production, only via merge from `dev`
- Tasks spawn worktrees → PRs back to `dev`
- Nightly PRs bundle end-of-day work → `dev`
- **IF YOU'RE ON `main`, YOU'RE LOST**

---

## Khal Timeout Fix
- Khal's WhatsApp instance (`0567bded-23f6-439f-b49f-773fa7f47419`) was hitting "taking longer than expected" errors
- **Root cause:** `agentTimeout` was 60s, but Khal runs on `claude-opus-4-6` with 315K/400K token context — easily exceeds 60s
- **Fix:** Bumped `agentTimeout` from 60s → 180s via production API (`https://felipe.omni.namastex.io`)
- Khal's session is dangerously stuffed at 315K tokens — may need compaction/reset if slowness persists
- `agentStreamMode: false` on Khal — streaming would improve UX but depends on stream-telegram wish

## Infrastructure Notes
- CLI config points to **production** API at `https://felipe.omni.namastex.io` (not localhost)
- Local DB (`postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:18433/omni`) is empty (dev instance, never seeded)
- API key for production: stored in CLI config (`omni config list`)
- Auth header: `x-api-key` (not `Authorization: Bearer`)
- PM2 processes: omni-v2-api, omni-v2-nats, omni-v2-pgserve, genie-os, genie-os-dev, khal-server, khal-frontend, term-bridge, totvs-api, totvs-ui
- API port: 18882 (env `API_PORT`)

## Stream Plumbing Status
- `stream-plumbing` wish marked COMPLETE but **changes are uncommitted** on `dev` branch (380 lines, 10 files)
- Files: provider.ts (triggerStream AsyncGenerator), client.ts (agent event routing), types.ts (StreamDelta/AgentEventPayload), channel-sdk types (StreamSender interface)
- `stream-telegram` wish is READY (depends on stream-plumbing)

## Nightly /goodnight Autonomy Protocol (Felipe)
- Felipe wants **autonomous nightly execution**: he will send `/goodnight` every day
- Agent should pick **everything it can deliver without asking**, as long as it follows the **Genie wish protocol**
- Deliver **one PR per night** targeting `dev` (nightly branch → PR to dev), by **morning (9–11am)**
- Each night must include **at least one quick win** (lint/cleanup/optimization/security/dead code/etc.)
- Branch naming OK: `nightly/*` / `night/*` / `owl/*` (pick one and standardize)
- Future: create "teams of octopuses" (focus areas: security, dead code, lint, optimization, token saving, etc.)

## Nightly Backlog (Sleepyhead Queue)
1. **[SHIPPED]** `stream-telegram` — TelegramStreamSender + dispatcher streaming path (PR #23)
2. **[QUEUED]** Full bilateral feature parity audit: Telegram ↔ WhatsApp
   - Map every feature each platform supports via their libs (grammy vs baileys)
   - Identify gaps: what Telegram has that WhatsApp doesn't, and vice versa
   - Match equivalents: reactions, read receipts, typing, media types, groups, threads/topics, buttons/inline keyboards, polls, contacts, location, stickers, voice messages, etc.
   - Plan: streaming for WhatsApp too (WhatsApp doesn't support editMessage natively — need alternative UX like "typing..." → final message, or WhatsApp Web edit API if available)
   - The night task output: a full wish document mapping both channels to 100% feature parity where platform allows
   - This IS an Omni superpower: translate any feature across any messaging system. Emoji reactions, file systems, presence, receipts — every system has its feature set, Omni bridges them all.

## Khal's Last Activity
- Khal was mapping Felipe's two WhatsApp numbers (+5512982298888 and +5511986780008) to same person
- Updated contacts.json and MEMORY.md in khal repo
- "Human Board" group deprecated in favor of "Khal - Dev" group
- Omni doesn't have person merge feature yet — both numbers remain separate persons in DB

## 🚨 Khal WhatsApp Disconnected (device_removed) — ~07:48 UTC
- **Root cause:** WhatsApp sent `stream:error` code 401, conflict type `device_removed`
- The linked device Khal was using got removed (either manually from phone or by WhatsApp)
- Baileys logged: `wasLoggedOut: true`, `willReconnect: false`
- Instance marked `isActive: false` — Khal is **completely offline**
- All outbound send attempts fail with `Instance 0567bded not connected`
- Last successful inbound event: ~11:31 UTC (messages still arrive to Omni but can't be replied to)
- **Fix required:** Felipe must re-scan QR code via `omni instances connect 0567bded-...`
- This is a physical action — no code fix possible, needs phone access
- Felipe was told at 12:35 BRT; people are relying on Khal now

## Recurring Bug: UUID Parse Error on Group JID
- Every ~5 minutes, API throws `invalid input syntax for type uuid: "120363424660366845@g.us"`
- Some code path is passing a WhatsApp group JID where a Postgres UUID column is expected
- Pre-existing issue, not caused by the disconnect — been in logs all day
- Not blocking but very noisy; should be filed as a bug

## Production PM2 Status (as of 12:35 BRT)
- Only 3 PM2 processes on omni@10.114.1.140: omni-v2-api (21h uptime, 42 restarts), omni-v2-nats (2D), omni-v2-pgserve (5D)
- Previous note listed more PM2 processes (khal-server, genie-os, etc.) — those may be on a different host or were stopped
- SSH to prod: `ssh omni@10.114.1.140`, pm2 at `/home/omni/.bun/bin/pm2`

## Khal Smart Response Gate — Fully Shipped
- Reviewed the QA report: all Groups A–E completed and validated
- Features live: allowlist mode, per-chat sessions, name match with LLM gate, per-context debounce (60s DM / 5min group)
- Gate uses flash model, fail-open, bypassed on @mention/reply
- All working perfectly UNTIL the device got removed today

## Late Session Learnings (22:00+ BRT)
- Felipe reinforced: stop doing roundabout tool paths for Omni operations — prefer the native `omni` CLI first.
- Messaging to Omni groups worked via `omni send --to <chatJid> --text "..."`; OpenClaw `message` tool target resolution did not.
- Correct discovery flow for group targets:
  1) `omni chats list --search "<name>" --verbose`
  2) use internal `chat.id` for `omni chats messages`
  3) use `externalId` (e.g. `120...@g.us`) for `omni send --to`.
- Confirmed active group: **Omni Council 🐙** with external JID `120363406791018058@g.us`.
- Brainstorm kickoff priorities agreed (quick wins, phased):
  1) timestamp versioning (`2.YYYYMMDD.N`),
  2) branch governance (`feat/* -> dev`, no direct main commits),
  3) nightly automation.
- Phase-1 scope preference: **CLI + API together** plus 1-line short hints for:
  - update available,
  - client/server mismatch.
- Strategic UX direction: converge to nearly automatic updates with a simple `omni update`, and reduce server/client distinction complexity currently centered on installer scripts.

## Version Handshake + omni update — SHIPPED (22:45-23:35 BRT)
- Wish `cli-version-handshake-update` fully executed via /make skill
- Committed and pushed to dev at `37cb2b6`
- 5 execution groups, 3 sub-agents + 2 inline fixes

### What shipped:
1. **`scripts/generate-version.ts`** — generates `version.json` with `2.YYYYMMDD.N` format
2. **Makefile `version` target** — wired as dependency of `build`
3. **Jenkinsfile + Jenkinsfile.dev** — additive: `bun run scripts/generate-version.ts` before build
4. **`packages/api/src/middleware/version-headers.ts`** — sets `x-omni-server-version` + mismatch hint on all responses
5. **`packages/cli/src/version.ts`** — centralized version detection (artifact → package.json → git hash fallback)
6. **`packages/cli/src/commands/update.ts`** — `omni update [--dev] [--force]`, git-based, preserves config
7. **`packages/cli/src/commands/status.ts`** — shows version match/mismatch hint
8. **`packages/cli/src/index.ts`** — `omni --version` shows server comparison
9. **`packages/cli/src/config.ts`** — `updateChannel` config key (`main|dev`)
10. **`.gitignore`** — `version.json` excluded (generated artifact)

### Sub-agent reliability issues (IMPORTANT for future /make):
- Sub-agents on codex model have **tool call encoding corruption** — edits show as garbled JSON in findings text instead of actually landing
- Must ALWAYS verify sub-agent output with `git diff` / file reads before moving on
- Both G1 and G4 reported successful edits that **did not land** (Jenkinsfile wiring, CLI index.ts wiring)
- Fix: applied those edits manually after verifying what was missing
- Biome complexity warnings need manual resolution (sub-agents don't handle lint fixes well)

### Workflow lesson:
- Felipe says "finish this already" when I'm doing too many round-trips — batch edits, don't ask per-group

## Instance Roles — Felipe's Two WhatsApps (19:00+ BRT)
- **`felipe-listener`** (`cdbb6ca3`, +5512982298888, pessoal) — Copilot mode. Felipe envia comandos, bot busca info, faz sweep.
- **`felipe-actor`** (`71b5dc10`, +5511986780008, Namastex) — Proxy mode. Bot age COMO Felipe, manda mensagens, responde pessoas.
- Instances renamed in production API to reflect roles
- Pattern: **read/write split** — listener is the "eye" (reads, searches, organizes), actor is the "mouth" (speaks, acts, responds to third parties)

## API Key Created for Felipe's Bot
- Name: `felipe-bot` (id `0802e520`)
- Key: `omni_sk_mOZZ66PCMDKi5KEgOKxAxqqLeEJphG9l`
- Scopes: messages:send/read, instances:read, chats:read/write, events:read
- Restricted to: felipe-listener + felipe-actor instances only

## PATCH /persons/:id — Quick Win Shipped
- Added PATCH endpoint for persons (displayName, primaryEmail, primaryPhone, avatarUrl, metadata jsonb)
- Service `persons.update()` already existed — just needed the route + Zod schema
- Committed to `nightly/2026-02-12`, pushed to PR #23
- This enables Felipe AI to enrich contacts (add emails, notes, tags, metadata)

## Agent Address Book — Pre-Wish + Vision
- From conversation with Felipe: agents need their own "address book"
- persons table is global/shared, auto-created from messages, was read-only
- Vision: neural map of people ↔ agents (1:N, N:1, granular permissions)
- Phases: (1) CRUD completion ✅ PATCH done, POST still needed, (2) agent↔person relationships table, (3) smart enrichment
- Pre-wish written: `.genie/wishes/agent-address-book/wish.md`
- Bead: `omni-s9r`

## New Beads Created (Backlog)
| Bead | Feature | Priority |
|------|---------|----------|
| `omni-cqa` | Instance Roles: listener vs actor mode | P1 |
| `omni-s9r` | Agent Address Book: per-agent contacts + CRUD | P1 |
| `omni-e87` | Channel Feature Parity: Telegram ↔ WhatsApp | P2 |
| `omni-7og` | WhatsApp StreamSender | P2 |
| `omni-ltv` | Cross-channel reaction translation | P2 |

## Dev Branch Merge + Rebase (19:00 BRT)
- Merged `origin/main` into `dev` (Cezar's commits: identity fixes, tracing, Claude Code provider)
- Conflict in `.gitignore` resolved (kept both worktree + memory entries)
- Had to install `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` (missing dependency from Cezar's provider commit)
- Re-extracted `checkAccessWithFallback` helper (lost during merge — Cezar's main had the pre-refactor version)
- Also deduplicated reaction access check using same helper
- WhatsApp `sendMessage` complexity (17 > 15 max) pre-existing from main — not fixed, noted
- `dev` pushed (41 commits ahead), `nightly/2026-02-12` rebased on top, force-pushed
- PR #23 updated: https://github.com/automagik-dev/omni/pull/23

## profileMetadata Not Exposed in PATCH
- Instance PATCH endpoint doesn't include `profileBio` or `profileMetadata` in `updateInstanceSchema`
- These are only set via profile sync (GET /instances/:id/sync-profile)
- Tried PATCH with these fields — silently ignored by Zod .partial()
- Used instance `name` rename as workaround for now
- Need to add these to `createInstanceSchema` or a separate profile update endpoint

## Git Hygiene Note
- Accidentally committed the persons PATCH to `main` (was on wrong branch after rebase operations)
- Fixed: cherry-picked to nightly, reset main to origin/main
- Lesson: ALWAYS `git branch --show-current` before committing after branch operations

## "Felipe" Confusion
- Someone (possibly Felipe's bot or another user) reported "Omni has 0 instances, DB is empty"
- That's the LOCAL dev DB (localhost:18433) — production at `felipe.omni.namastex.io` has 8 instances, all healthy
- Production API: 8 instances total, 7 connected
- Likely a mismatch where the client was pointing at localhost instead of production URL
