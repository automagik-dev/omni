# 2026-02-10 — Self-Awareness Audit

## What Happened

Felipe asked me to audit the backlog — check what's actually done vs what I thought was in progress. Spawned 5 parallel tentacles on flash model (~$0.04 total) to audit in parallel:

1. **audit-heartbeat** — HEARTBEAT.md items vs reality
2. **audit-in-progress** — 3 IN_PROGRESS wishes
3. **audit-drafts-1** — 8 DRAFT wishes against codebase
4. **audit-drafts-2** — 10 more DRAFT wishes
5. **audit-health** — MEMORY.md items + `make check` + git status

## Key Findings

### Status Corrections (7 wishes had wrong status)
- **baileys-quick-wins** IN_PROGRESS → SHIPPED (merged ff68219)
- **cli-dx-improvements** IN_PROGRESS → SHIPPED (merged d8ecb90)
- **fix-ui-typecheck** READY → SHIPPED (PR #19 merged)
- **api-key-security** DRAFT → SHIPPED (schema has expires_at, revoked_at)
- **discord-interactivity** DRAFT → SHIPPED (slash commands + modals in code)
- **baileys-esm-fix** DRAFT → N/A (Bun bypasses the issue)
- **NATS consumer fix** OPEN → DONE (df31c0a)

### Health Issues
- `make check` FAILS — lint blocks on cognitive complexity in 4 files
- 6 stale git stashes
- 2 dirty files uncommitted
- `feat/medium-features` branch complete but not merged

### True Backlog (actually still open)
**Operational:**
- QR re-scan for Genie + Helena (manual)
- Prod PATH for omni CLI
- Scroll cron wiring
- Cognitive complexity refactors (blocking lint)

**Feature DRAFTs (no code):**
- channel-email-gmail, channel-whatsapp-cloud, claude-code-provider
- openclaw-provider-integration, mcp-server, omni-skill
- pix-button-research, events-refactor, enterprise-compliance

**Partially done:**
- channel-telegram (code exists, not wired)
- provider-system-refactor (Agno still hardcoded)
- medium-features C1-C7 (branch ready, needs merge)

## Files Updated
- HEARTBEAT.md — removed done items, added real blockers
- MEMORY.md — corrected open items, added audit table
- 6 wish files — status corrections
