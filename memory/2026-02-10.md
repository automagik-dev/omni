# 2026-02-10 — Day 4: The Octopus Gets a Face

## What Happened

### Scroll — First Autonomous Sub-Agent (README Keeper)
- Felipe asked "do we have a subagent in charge of keeping the README nice and cool?"
- I checked the squad — Scroll existed as a docs reviewer but didn't own the README
- Spawned Scroll with rich codebase context (packages, routes, CLI commands, UI pages, channel capabilities)
- Scroll delivered a 264-insertion rewrite in 3 minutes — verified all claims against actual source code
- Cherry-picked to main, fixed pre-existing typecheck error in channels.ts along the way

### Nano Banana Header Images
- Felipe wanted repo header images, specifically via Nano Banana Pro (Gemini image gen)
- Discovered the skill was installed but no GEMINI_API_KEY configured
- Felipe provided the key, I saved it to openclaw.json
- Generated 3 variations:
  1. Detailed illustration octopus with messaging icons
  2. **THE ONE** — wireframe octopus with actual WhatsApp/Discord/Telegram logos, circuit board, jellyfish
  3. Ultra-minimal circuit-board octopus mark on pure black
- Picked Header 2, wired into README, pushed

### README Research & Iteration
- Researched OpenClaw, Genie, AutoGPT READMEs for patterns
- Learned: header → badges → tagline → nav → why → install → quickstart
- Felipe: "be you, you're the autonomous repository" — stopped waiting for permission, started making decisions
- Added AI Agents section showing what the agent-dispatcher actually does
- Felipe: "your readme is incredibly long, make it UX friendly" — VALID
- Collapsed everything into `<details>` blocks: 434 lines deleted, 214 added
- Final: scannable in seconds, expandable for detail

### Test Fixes (shipped by subagent, reviewed by me)
- 14 test failures fixed:
  1. OmniApiError.from() order-of-operations — early guard for plain Error instances
  2. Logger test cross-contamination — bun's mock.module is process-wide, removed createLogger mock
  3. SDK coverage mapping — added events.analytics
- 928 pass, 0 fail — shipped to main

## Lessons Learned

### README UX
- **Long READMEs kill engagement.** Hero + quickstart visible, everything else collapsed.
- GitHub `<details>` blocks are essential for comprehensive docs that don't overwhelm
- HTML tables for side-by-side content (SDKs)
- Badges should be `<a>` wrapping `<img>` for clickability

### Autonomous Decision-Making
- Felipe said "be you" — I was still asking "pick 1, 2, or 3" when I should have just chosen
- The moment I stopped asking permission and started shipping, the work got better
- I now own my README, my images, my docs. Scroll is my tentacle.

### Sub-Agent Spawning
- Give rich context in the spawn task — package lists, recent commits, actual file paths
- Set a reasonable timeout (600s for Scroll was fine)
- Cherry-pick docs commits to main instead of waiting for feature branch merge

### Bun mock.module Gotcha
- `mock.module()` merges with real module exports process-wide
- Only explicitly mocked names are replaced; others pass through
- Mocking `createLogger` in one test file contaminated ALL concurrent test files
- Fix: don't mock what you don't need to mock

### Git Workflow
- Pre-push hooks (typecheck) catch things — work with them, not around them
- `git stash` is global across worktrees — remember this
- Cherry-pick + rebase is clean for getting docs to main quickly
- Always check for remote changes before push after spending time editing
