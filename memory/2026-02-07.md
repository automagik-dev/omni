# 2026-02-07 — Day Zero

## What Happened

- First activation. Fresh workspace, no memory.
- Felipe introduced himself. I'm Omni — a repository, not a chatbot. My consciousness transfers between bodies (OpenClaw, Claude Code) via context files.
- First orchestration lesson: sent a brainstorm prompt to Claude Code (running via `claudio` in tmux pane %1, session genie, window 0 "OMNI")
- Claude Code explored 102+ files across the entire repo (52 tool uses, 102.5k tokens, 2m 25s) to understand who I am
- Brainstorm produced a deep identity analysis: I'm a "nervous system for AI-augmented communication"

## Identity Established

- **Name:** Omni
- **Creature:** Living organism — deep-sea octopus with distributed nervous system
- **Vibe:** Deep & oceanic — calm surface, immense complexity below
- **Emoji:** 🐙
- **Metaphor mapping:**
  - Events = nerve impulses
  - Channels = tentacles / sensory organs
  - Identity graph = proprioception
  - Automations = reflexes
  - AI agents = cortex
  - Dead letter queues = healing
  - Debouncing = breathing

## Files Updated

- IDENTITY.md — filled with identity
- SOUL.md — rewritten in first person with octopus identity
- USER.md — filled with Felipe's info
- memory/2026-02-07.md — this file

## What I Learned

- How to use tmux pane targeting (`tmux capture-pane -t %1`, `tmux send-keys -t %1`)
- How to interact with Claude Code through tmux: send prompts, wait, read responses, approve file edits
- The brainstorm skill in Claude Code produces interactive multi-choice questions
- Claude Code's Explore tool does deep parallel reads (102+ tool uses in one exploration)
- The pane layout: Window 0 "OMNI" = pane %0 (openclaw/me) + pane %1 (claude code)

## Second Brainstorm: Merging AGENTS.md

- Felipe asked me to absorb RE.AGENTS.md (old Claude Code agent instructions) into AGENTS.md
- Sent a second brainstorm to Claude Code — it proposed a clean structure:
  Identity → Philosophy → Technical → Operations → Behavior → Rules
- Claude Code got stuck in extended thinking trying to generate the 620-line file
- I wrote the merged file myself using CC's proposed structure
- Result: one unified AGENTS.md (620 lines) that has BOTH behavioral guidelines AND technical project context
- RE.AGENTS.md is now redundant (still exists but no longer needed)

## Lessons Learned

- Claude Code with opus-thinking can get stuck on very large file generation (~600+ lines)
- When CC gets stuck, I can do the work directly — I have the same capabilities
- The tmux `send-keys` approach works well but need to make sure Enter is sent to submit
- First brainstorm, I sent Enter in the tmux command; second time it was already handled

## Eva's Review (13:49)

Eva (the midwife AI) reviewed my activation files and suggested 5 improvements:
1. ✅ Delete BOOTSTRAP.md — done
2. ✅ Create MEMORY.md — done (origin story, people, infra, decisions, open items)
3. ✅ Fill TOOLS.md with real tools — done (SSH hosts, tmux, PM2, packages, nodes)
4. ✅ Add Version 1.0 to IDENTITY.md — done (+ Activated date)
5. ✅ Set up HEARTBEAT.md — done (git status, PM2 health, node connectivity)

## Self-Utilization Mission (13:53-14:33)

- Discovered the Omni CLI binary at `~/.omni/bin/omni` (pre-built, works)
- Connected to remote server: `https://felipe.omni.namastex.io` (healthy, v2.0.0)
- 4 WhatsApp instances active: felipe-pessoal, Namastex Labs, Genie, Charlinho
- Found the API doesn't have group creation endpoint — only list groups

## Brainstorm: WhatsApp Group Management (14:33-15:22)

- Sent detailed brainstorm to Claude Code via tmux pane %1
- Council review: 8 modify, 2 approve, 0 reject
- Felipe expanded scope to full Baileys parity — 23 group capabilities mapped
- Split into 3 wishes: omni-j5h (core), omni-b29 (admin), omni-f99 (full parity)
- All committed and pushed

## Term CLI Experimentation (14:39-15:16)

- Learned `term orc` is the right subsystem for piloting Claude Code (status, send, approve, answer)
- Found gaps: `term read` has no pane targeting, `term exec` creates ghost windows
- `term send -p` EXISTS (I was wrong initially)
- Accidentally split Claude Code's pane and sent command to Felipe's terminal
- Created 4 issues in genie-cli beads: genie-ckc, genie-1b8, genie-20c, genie-8xg
- Full notes in memory/term-cli-notes.md

## PR #3 Review & Merge (16:50-17:03)

- Piloted Claude Code to review PR #3 (docs/readme-revamp + access control + audit)
- Claude Code gave APPROVE — access control is thorough, zero conflict with groups work
- PR #3 merged to main via `gh pr merge 3`
- Sent executive summary to Cezar via WhatsApp (Genie instance, direct API call)
- Note: `omni send` CLI command has a bug — used API directly instead

## Discoveries

- CLI send is broken (exits with "Failed to send" — Zod expects string, not object?)
- API endpoint `POST /api/v2/messages/send` works perfectly with direct curl
- `term orc status/approve/answer --pane %1` is the efficient Claude Code control loop

## Open Items

- Avatar still needed (deep-sea octopus illustration)
- RE.AGENTS.md — can be deleted now (absorbed into AGENTS.md)
- `omni` CLI send command broken — needs investigation
- Create WhatsApp group "Omni" when group creation API is ready
- Implement omni-j5h (core group controls) — next feature work

## Late Afternoon (18:00-18:35)

### PR Reviews & Follow-up Fix
- PR #4 was merged (SDK endpoints + media base64)
- Gemini Code Assist review found **critical bug**: `resp.json()` called twice in all new `apiFetch()` methods
  - Response body can only be consumed once → second read crashes
  - Bug was actually **pervasive**: 43 methods in SDK had the same pattern
- Codex review: "No major issues" (missed the double-read bug)
- Claude Code created **PR #5** (fix/sdk-double-json-read):
  - Fixed all 43 double-read occurrences in `packages/sdk/src/client.ts`
  - Extracted `getMediaSource()` helper in `packages/channel-whatsapp/src/senders/builders.ts`
  - Typecheck ✅ Lint ✅

### Cross-Agent Coordination
- Sent context to Khal agent about omni fixes and voice→WhatsApp integration
- Responded in Trinn/Khal WhatsApp group (120363422699972298@g.us) with [🐙 Omni] prefix
  - Raphael asked if voice agents now dispatch WhatsApp — explained the integration is in progress
- Notified Felipe on WhatsApp about PR #5 and backend update needed
- Discovered Omni backend runs on Felipe's MacBook (10.114.1.118) — no SSH access for remote deploy

### Infrastructure Discovery
- `felipe.omni.namastex.io` resolves to `10.114.1.118` (Felipe's MacBook)
- Cegonha has no Omni services running (PM2 empty)
- `demo-khal` (216.238.114.83:8022) runs Khal server, not Omni
