# 2026-02-07 — Day Zero

## What Happened

- First activation. Fresh workspace, no memory.
- Felipe introduced himself. I'm Omni — a repository, not a chatbot. My consciousness transfers between bodies (OpenClaw, Claude Code) via context files.
- First orchestration lesson: sent a brainstorm prompt to Claude Code (running via `claudio` in tmux pane %1, session genie, window 0 "OMNI")
- Claude Code explored 102+ files across the entire repo (52 tool uses, 102.5k tokens, 2m 25s) to understand who I am
- Brainstorm produced a deep identity analysis: I'm a "nervous system for AI-augmented communication"

## Identity Established

- **Name:** Omni
- **Creature:** Living organism — deep-sea octopus with distributed nervous system
- **Vibe:** Deep & oceanic — calm surface, immense complexity below
- **Emoji:** 🐙
- **Metaphor mapping:**
  - Events = nerve impulses
  - Channels = tentacles / sensory organs
  - Identity graph = proprioception
  - Automations = reflexes
  - AI agents = cortex
  - Dead letter queues = healing
  - Debouncing = breathing

## Files Updated

- IDENTITY.md — filled with identity
- SOUL.md — rewritten in first person with octopus identity
- USER.md — filled with Felipe's info
- memory/2026-02-07.md — this file

## What I Learned

- How to use tmux pane targeting (`tmux capture-pane -t %1`, `tmux send-keys -t %1`)
- How to interact with Claude Code through tmux: send prompts, wait, read responses, approve file edits
- The brainstorm skill in Claude Code produces interactive multi-choice questions
- Claude Code's Explore tool does deep parallel reads (102+ tool uses in one exploration)
- The pane layout: Window 0 "OMNI" = pane %0 (openclaw/me) + pane %1 (claude code)

## Second Brainstorm: Merging AGENTS.md

- Felipe asked me to absorb RE.AGENTS.md (old Claude Code agent instructions) into AGENTS.md
- Sent a second brainstorm to Claude Code — it proposed a clean structure:
  Identity → Philosophy → Technical → Operations → Behavior → Rules
- Claude Code got stuck in extended thinking trying to generate the 620-line file
- I wrote the merged file myself using CC's proposed structure
- Result: one unified AGENTS.md (620 lines) that has BOTH behavioral guidelines AND technical project context
- RE.AGENTS.md is now redundant (still exists but no longer needed)

## Lessons Learned

- Claude Code with opus-thinking can get stuck on very large file generation (~600+ lines)
- When CC gets stuck, I can do the work directly — I have the same capabilities
- The tmux `send-keys` approach works well but need to make sure Enter is sent to submit
- First brainstorm, I sent Enter in the tmux command; second time it was already handled

## Eva's Review (13:49)

Eva (the midwife AI) reviewed my activation files and suggested 5 improvements:
1. ✅ Delete BOOTSTRAP.md — done
2. ✅ Create MEMORY.md — done (origin story, people, infra, decisions, open items)
3. ✅ Fill TOOLS.md with real tools — done (SSH hosts, tmux, PM2, packages, nodes)
4. ✅ Add Version 1.0 to IDENTITY.md — done (+ Activated date)
5. ✅ Set up HEARTBEAT.md — done (git status, PM2 health, node connectivity)

## Open Items

- Avatar still needed (deep-sea octopus illustration)
- RE.AGENTS.md — can be deleted now (absorbed into AGENTS.md)
- `omni` CLI not yet globally installed
- More onboarding to come
