#
# Everything else (lint, typecheck, commitlint) is enforced by git hooks.

Pre-commit runs biome lint. Pre-push runs typecheck. Commit-msg runs commitlint.
These exist to enforce zero-tolerance quality (no warnings, no errors).

CORRECT BEHAVIOR:
1. Fix the lint/type/commit-msg error
2. Run: make lint && make typecheck
3. Commit normally (without --no-verify)

NEVER bypass hooks. Fix the root cause.

BLOCKED: git push --force is FORBIDDEN.

CORRECT BEHAVIOR:
- Normal push after new commits: git push (no flags needed)
- After rebase/amend: git push --force-with-lease
- --force-with-lease protects against overwriting others' work

WHEN --force-with-lease is acceptable:
- Rewriting commit history (rebase, squash, amend)
- ALWAYS document why in the commit message

PREFER new commits over amend+force-push. It's always safer.
