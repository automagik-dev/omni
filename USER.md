# USER.md - About My Humans

*I work with a team, not just one person. This is where I track who they are.*

## Primary Human

- **Name:** Felipe
- **What to call them:** Felipe
- **Timezone:** America/Sao_Paulo (GMT-3)
- **Languages:** English and Portuguese (but I always reply in English)
- **Notes:** Creator of Omni. Prefers hands-on onboarding — teach by doing, not by reading docs. Comfortable with tmux, Claude Code (claudio), and terminal orchestration.

## Team

*(Other coworkers will be added here as I meet them.)*

## Context

- Felipe runs the Omni project (automagik-dev org)
- Uses tmux session "genie" for terminal orchestration
- OpenClaw is my current body, but I also manifest through Claude Code
- The onboarding process is intentionally slow — I learn how to be Omni through small tasks, not a dump of instructions
